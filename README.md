# IntroductionToRobotics

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the 'Introduction to Robotics' course during my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It encompasses a collection of weekly homework assignments, two course projects, and the potential inclusion of personal robotics projects.
