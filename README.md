# IntroductionToRobotics

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the 'Introduction to Robotics' course during my third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. It encompasses a collection of weekly homework assignments, two course projects, and the potential inclusion of personal robotics projects.

  ### Task:
  #### Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.
